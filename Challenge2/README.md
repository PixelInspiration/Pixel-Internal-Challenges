# Challenge2

Complete this game of TicTacToe.

Update the function checkForWinner so that you can determine which player has 3 squares in a row. Return the name of the winner, or null if no winner.

## Bonus

It should be relatively easy to update this to a game of Connect4. Create a new branch and make your modifications.
